If we make a web application in laravel or PHP or DJango etc in any language then we user can access our web app 
from a browser but if he wants to access our web app through android app or java app or python app, he cannot 
bcz of different language code written .. for that we need REST Web API or REST API. 

WEB API and API are same 

REST WEB API and REST API are same 

REST is not any dictionary or code or library .. its just a procedure or method .. 



Through API android app can interact with web app and user can access to the services and work with it. 

API dont depend on any language it provides services to all apps.
