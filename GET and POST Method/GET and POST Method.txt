user searches a product samsung a32.. then program shows him the product.

user send request to Api,s post request about samsung a32 .. Api then gets the model id of samsung a32 by GET method .. and then
Api sends the MODEL ID to the user in front end.



search samsung a32 			= POST request got hit 
Multiple samsung a32 on screen		= Filter method here .. multiple samsung a32 given black blue editon etc etc mutliple ID's given.
User click on samsung a32 black 	= Api use GET method to GET a single ID from data base ( eg: ID number 50 is samsung a32 black) 





The upper scenario was run over Post request	[ def POST(request,) ] and by default django writes GET Method. 

user hits Post request and Post request then uses Get Method.
