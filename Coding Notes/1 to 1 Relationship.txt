1 to 1 database relationship !! 

Suppose that we have an entity called employe.. and 1 more entity called department .. there is a relation between both entities called work. 

employee == work == department 

now we  make employee table ...what will be the attributes in employee table ? lets say 

employee id = eid
employee name = ename
employee age = eage

name and age can be same but id will always be unique auto generated .. 

now in department table the attributes will be 

department id = did
department name = dname
department address =dadress

name and address can be same but again id will be unique will always be.

now suppose the relationship table name is work .. 

work will tell us that which employee is working in which department. 

what will be the attributes in work table.

There can be many attributes in relationship table called work . but 2 attributes will always be in relationship table. must ! 

that is    

eid = employee id
did = department id 

eid and did will act as foriegn key = fk

what is a foreign key ? 
A foreign key is a set of attributes in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key links these two tables. 

foreign key takes refrence from primary key . and whats primary key in database ? that will be something unique .. like here id is unique in both employee and department table .. 

so we will add both unique id's ( primary keys) inside relationship table and thats gonna be called foreign key now.

now relationship has been completed in terms of coding. 

foreign keys cannot be different then primary keys of the both tables.

foreign keys cannot be added more than once .. means .. if employee 1 = e1 works in department 2= e2 = and you write employee 1 = e1 works in department 3 = d3 .. its false 

e1 cant work in both departments at same time ., e1 is for d2 etc.. e2 is in d3...

this is called 1 to 1 relation .. 1 employee works in 1 department. simply 1 to 1 relationship concept. 

what will be the primary key in relationshio table (work) ? 

so employee table has primary key as employee id =eid .. departmend has = did

whats gonna be the primary key for relationship table ? its simple .. relationsip table has 2 attributes

eid or did . primary key for relationship table can be either eid or did. bcz they cant be changed or repeated. they are unique. 

why do we need primary key for relationship table when relationship table's 2 attributes got primary keys from eid and did and it became foreign key .. 

we can use relationship table's primary key to make another table and reduce number of tables.

how to reduce tables ? 

so here we have 3 tables . 
employee table .
relationship tanle ( work ) .
and department table .

eid |ename | age |       - eid | did -        did | dname  |  dL 
e1   adnan    20             e1     d1           d1       IT       karachi
e2   moiz      25             e3     e2           d2       prod   lahore
e3   ali          30             e2     d3           d3       hr       multan



we will simply merged primary keys of emplyee and work table ..

we will make a new table and we will add 4 attributes 

( NEW TABLE )
eid  | ename | age | did 
e1      adnan   20     d1 
e2      moiz      25    d3
e3      ali          30    d2


now we only got 2 tables 

1 is the new table with 4 attributes. and 2nd table is department table just give departmened unique id and we got everything. 

if u take eid . merge employee table with relationship table
eid + work = 2 tables 

if u take did . merge department table with relationship table
did + work = 2 tables
