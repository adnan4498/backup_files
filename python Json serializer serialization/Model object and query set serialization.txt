Model Object Serialization Process


stu = Student.objects.get(id=1)  # get the object with id number 1 

serializer = StudentSerializer(stu) # serializer is an instance (you can type any name here) then... StudentSerializer is our class we made earilier .. then  (stu) is model instance


Serializer is the method here to convert model object into native python data type






Query set ( full model data ) serialization process 

stu = Student.objects.all() # model stored in model instance (stu)

serializer = StudentSerializer(stu, many=True) # instance name serializer .. then (stu) is the model and (many = true) means there are many objects / fields in a model so its true.



for model object we dont use many=true bcz we get only 1 object
for full model / query set we use many=true !
